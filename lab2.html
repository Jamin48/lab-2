    <ol><h3>Aims</h3></ol>
    <p>
        <ol>
        This project-based unit focuses on developing your skills to build web applications <br>
        using web technologies. You'll work individually and in teams to tackle real-world <br>
        web development challenges, building proficiency in selecting and applying suitable <br>
        tools and techniques. The unit also covers essential aspects of security, ethics, <br>
        accessibility, and professional communication within web development. Guidance <br>
        from an academic facilitator will support you in mastering both technical skills and <br>
        collaborative project management techniques to achieve these objectives. <br>
